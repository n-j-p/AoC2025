Day 1: Wow part 2 was pretty hard for a day 1 problem, lots (relatively) of 
special cases to work through.

Day 2, Part 1: I adapted a palindrome generator I developed for Project Euler 
(problem 36).

Day 2, Part 2: Speaking of Project Euler I was tempted to bring out a meta-
generator I developed that interleaves an arbitrary number of pre-sorted 
generators into one big sorted generator, but hey it's only day 2 and it's
not really needed here.

Day 3: part 1 was easy enough with a BF approach. I'm not sure what the 
algorithm is called that my part 2 solution uses. It seems closest to a 
depth-first tree traversal.

Day 4: Pretty easy, I set up a Class.

Day 6: Just zip it! Zip it good.
